3. Removed unauthorized user eli: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
One of the first things you should do when starting an image during a competition is check the
README file on the desktop. The authorized administrators and users listed in the README are
the only users that should exist on the system (aside from legitimate built-in system accounts and
those used for services). All unauthorized user accounts should be removed.

•

How do I solve this problem?
Click the Show Applications button on the bottom of the Launcher and click Settings. Scroll down
and click on Users, then click Unlock in the upper right corner of the Settings window. If
prompted type the password of your current user account. The password for your current user
account can be found in the README. Select the user eli. Click on Remove User… Since this is a
competition environment and a further analysis of this user’s files is not necessary, click Delete
Files.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Computer access should be limited to just those who need to use it to complete their tasks. By
leaving unauthorized user accounts on the image, unauthorized individuals may be able to log
on to the computer and make changes that could affect the safety and security of legitimate
users. Unauthorized user accounts also give adversaries a greater attack surface. For example,
unauthorized user accounts increase the risk of having a user account compromised via
password cracking.

4. User cornelius is not an administrator: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
One of the first things you should do when starting an image during a competition is check the
README file on the desktop. The authorized administrators listed in the README are the only
users that are authorized have administrator level access. All users not in the list of authorized
administrators should have their administrator level access removed.

•

How do I solve this problem?
Click the Show Applications button on the bottom of the Launcher and click Settings. Scroll down
and click on Users, then click Unlock in the upper right corner of the Settings window. If
prompted type the password of your current user account. The password for your current user
account can be found in the README. Select the user cornelius. Click on the toggle button next
to Administrator.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Administrator level access gives individuals the ability to modify critical system files and functions
and should be limited to authorized individuals only. The more users with administrator level
access, the higher your risk, since compromising an account with administrator level access gives
an adversary complete control of the system.

5. Changed insecure password for user alice: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Ensuring users have strong passwords is an important principle of cybersecurity. In this instance
the README tells you the passwords of the authorized administrators. In practice, security
professionals use password auditing tools to help identify users with weak passwords.

•

How do I solve this problem?
Click the Show Applications button on the bottom of the Launcher and click Settings. Scroll down
and click on Users, then click Unlock in the upper right corner of the Settings window. If
prompted type the password of your current user account. The password for your current user
account can be found in the README. Select the user alice. Click the line labeled Password.
Select Set a password now. Choose a secure password and type it into the New Password and
Confirm New Password text boxes, and click Change.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Weak passwords can be easily and quickly compromised by adversaries via various password
cracking techniques. A compromised user account, even if it is not an administrator, can easily

and quickly lead to a compromised system and network.
6. Added mariya to group pioneers: 7 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
The README requests that you add a user to a group.

•

How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo gpasswd -a mariya pioneers. If prompted by sudo for a password, type
your current user’s password. The password for your current user account can be found in the
README.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
One important aspect of working as a security or IT professional is supporting business
operations and knowing how to do administrative tasks when requested. Additionally, knowing
how system administration tasks are performed and the consequences of those actions is
important as a security professional, because you must know in detail how an operating system
works before you can defend it.

7. A minimum password length is required: 4pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Password policies are set in the /etc/pam.d/common-password file. This file shows password rules
related to length, complexity, and history.

•

How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-password to edit the file. Find a line in the file
that contains password [success=2 default=ignore] pam_unix.so and add in the text minlen=8 .
This will set the requirement that all users must have passwords that are at least 8 characters
long. Click Save before closing out of the file to make sure your changes take effect. Any number
can be added here to set the required password length, but 8 or higher is recommended.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Having a password on a user account that is too short makes it extremely vulnerable to attacks by
outside individuals. With a weak password, an attacker can more easily gain access to a user’s
files. Strong passwords make it much more likely that only the authorized user of the account can
access it.

8. Null passwords do not authenticate: 6pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Account lockout policies are set in the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file. This file allows you to set
rules and conditions for users to sign-in to their account using their password.

•

How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth to edit the authentication configuration

file. Find the line that shows auth [success=2 default=ignore] pam_unix.so nullok . Remove the
“nullok” test and save the file.
•

Why is fixing this problem important?
The “nullok” text included in the common-auth file allows accounts with empty passwords to login
without a password prompt. This would make it easy for an attacker to gain access to your user
accounts without having a password.

9. Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) protection has been enabled: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Enabling a host-based firewall is very important to system security. The README tells you that
the only company approved firewall is UFW. You can check the status of UFW by typing sudo ufw
status. If prompted by sudo for a password, type your current user’s password. The password for
your current user account can be found in the README.

•

How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo ufw enable. If prompted by sudo for a password, type your current
user’s password. The password for your current user account can be found in the README.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Enabling and properly configuring a firewall is critical to ensuring that you are only allowing
known, authorized traffic in and out of your computer.

10. X2GO service has been installed and started: 5pts.
• How do I find this problem?
The ReadMe states that X2GO is required software that needs to be installed.
• How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo apt-get update and press Enter. Next, type sudo apt-get install
x2goserver to install the service. You will be prompted to enter your current user’s password.
Enter the password. Enter yes or Y to continue the installation.
• Why is fixing this problem important?
Installing the required software ensures that employees have everything that they need to
perform their jobs on their company computer. X2Go is a remote desktop software that allows a
user to access and manage another computer from a different location. This program is often
used by IT administrators.
11. Nginx service has been disabled or removed: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Stopping and disabling insecure or unnecessary services is an important principle of good
cybersecurity. Many services need to be running to ensure normal and secure operation of
computer systems. Reading about the services on your system and doing research can help you

determine the importance of a service and if it is necessary for normal operation. Additionally,
business-critical services listed in the README should remain running at all times. Running
services can be found by running the command systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active
in a terminal.
•

How do I solve this problem?
In a terminal, type sudo systemctl stop nginx to stop the service. If prompted by sudo for a
password, type your current user’s password. The password for your current user account can
be found in the README. After stopping the service, type sudo systemctl disable nginx to
prevent it from starting automatically in the future.

•

Why is fixing this problem important?
Disabling unnecessary services can limit your attack surface. The fewer services an adversary
has to attack and potentially exploit, the lower your risk. Adversaries may attack known or
unknown vulnerabilities in services to obtain information, escalate privileges, or gain
unauthorized access.

12. The system automatically checks for updates daily: 6 pts.
•

How do I find this problem?
Automatically checking for security updates is an important cybersecurity principle. In Ubuntu,
this can be checked and configured in the Software & Updates application.

•

How do I solve this problem?
Click the Show Applications button on the bottom of the Launcher and click Software & Updates
(you may select Settings on the pop-up box). In the Updates tab, select the dropdown box next
